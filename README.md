## 1. Structure of the project

### 1.1. Dataset

It simply contains all the files storing the data used in the project.

It gathers csv and xlsx files storing the information about the customers, the vehicles, the 
depots.

### 1.2. Metaheuristics

It contains the implementation of the 3 metaheuristics studied (genetic algorithm, tabou algorithm,
simulated annealing), as well as all functions used in specific metaheuristics code.

### 1.3. Sma

It contains all files related to the multi-agent system implementation.

- **sma.py** : define the agent and model classes for the SMA
- **interactions.py** : define the scenarios of interactions between the agent within the SMA

### 1.4. QLearning

It contains all files related to the q-learning part.

### 1.4. Utility

It contains all classes and functions used through the whole project.

- **database.py** : read the dataset files and store them in a pandas dataframe
- **validator.py** : check that all constraints are matched by a solution generated by the algorithm
- **common.py** : all functions used several times and common in all algorithms
- **pool.py** : manage the pool of solution used in the SMA
- **plotter.py** : manage the plotting of graph and chart, to display the solutions

## 2. Metaheuristics

### 2.1. Tabou algorithm

### 2.2. Simulated annealing

### 2.3. Genetic algorithm
