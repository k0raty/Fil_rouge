# Test

> *Updated on the 28th of April 2022*

We don't have proper unit test and test checking script.

Therefor we usually create one test file per python file in the project,
and we write a short script to test its functions and manually check the validity of the result.

Not an amazing practice, but testing is not the core of our school project.
